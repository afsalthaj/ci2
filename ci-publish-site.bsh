#   Generic CI system documentation publication script. This is designed to be
#   run after setup-version.bsh to publish a version number to releaseVersion
#   in _config.yml. Any existing key with this name will be removed.
#   <directory> is relative to the current working directory. The remote pushed
#   to is always 'origin'.
#
#   Usage:
#   ./ci/ci-publish-site.bsh <branch> <directory> <commit msg>
#
#   Example:
#   ./ci/ci-publish-site.bsh gh-pages _site "Automatic Update"
